#Installation

Installing “Only the Essentials” is very simple.

**Prerequisites**

In order to set up this theme you must:

* have a Reddit account,
* be a moderator with the “config” permission on the subreddit that you're trying to tweak.

**Install Process**

Once the prerequisites are met, installation is ridiculously easy.

* First, head over to your subreddit. In this example, I'll be using ``/r/MVILCIScss``.
* Next, look to the sidebar—click “edit stylesheet.”
* A page with a code editor should appear. Copy and paste the stylesheet from the ``stylesheet.css`` file.
* Click “save.”

That's it! The changes should be reflected to everyone immediatly.

#Frequently Asked Questions

##I'm having trouble with some part of your theme. Where can I ask for help?

For speedy support, visit [/r/CSShelp](https://reddit.com/r/CSShelp). You can ask questions about the theme specifically on [/r/OnlytheEssentials](https://reddit.com/r/onlytheessentials) as well but the response delay might be a bit longer. [/r/RedditHax](https://reddit.com/r/reddithax), [/r/SelectorLegend](https://reddit.com/r/selectorlegend) and [/r/CSSTutorials](https://reddit.com/r/CSSTutorials) also might be handy.

##Where do I add my modifications?

You can do so below or above the stylesheet. **Please do not edit the code directly!** Most browsers scan code from the top to the bottom sequentially. You might want to consider prioritizing on what to load first if your readers' connections are as slow as Comcast's Internet speeds.

##Where can I suggest new features or changes that could be made to this theme?

Here on GitHub or on [/r/OnlytheEssentials](https://reddit.com/r/onlytheessentials).

##Can I remove the “Theme by /u/mvilcis” notice?

No! Don't just take all that ~~credit~~ possible karma away from me! Do credits really bother you that much anyway?
